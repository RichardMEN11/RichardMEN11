I'm Richard, a Full-Stack Developer based in Germany. I'm a firm believer in the power of technology and startups to change the world.

> What if changing the world was just about being here, by showing up no matter how many times we get told we donâ€™t belong, by staying true even when weâ€™re shamed into being false, by believing in ourselves even when weâ€™re told weâ€™re too different? And if we all held on to that, if we refuse to budge and fall in line, if we stood our ground for long enough, just maybeâ€¦ The world canâ€™t help but change around us.

- Elliot Alderson

I live by this quote from Elliot Alderson, the protagonist of the TV series Mr. Robot. By staying true to ourselves and refusing to conform, we have the power to change the world. I believe that everything can be learned, and I'm committed to a growth mindset that helps me continue to learn and grow every day.

Stay safe and keep hacking!
